My solution for the Bank Assignment

*Create a Client application, which*  
* opens connection to a server with a specific IP address and port 
* reads data from the user: account number and (+ or -) amount of money 
* sends the data to the Server 

*Create Server application that*
* defines initial amount of money in the userâ€™s account 
* opens connection at the specific port and accepts to listen to the client 
* reads the request of the client and processes it: 
* if the user wants to make savings (+), add the input amount to the current amount 
* if the user wants to withdraw money (-), checks the availability, and then either subtracts the input amount from the current amount or prints a warning message 
* returns a response
